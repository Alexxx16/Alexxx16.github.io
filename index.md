## CPSC 120


* Lab 5 (https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-05-sebastian-and-alexander)
    Lab 5, part 1 was one of my favorites out of the three because I love food and coding, so when the both combined it make me interested in how to print out orders. Not only that but we also print out three different arguments being the protein, bread, and condiment.

* Lab 6 (https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-06-sebastian-p-alexander-l)
    Lab 6, part 2 was my second favorite because this is one of the first games we actually coded. It is more complex then the high and low game which makes it more rewarding to code it correctly.

* Lab 7(https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-07-daniel-h-and-alexander-l)
    Lab 7, Part 2 was very interesting due to the fact that it was pretty challenging. I remeber first stressing in this lab specifcally but thanks to my partner it worked out great.
